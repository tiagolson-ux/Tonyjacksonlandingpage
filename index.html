  <h2>Research Spotlight: Little TJ&rsquo;s Journey &amp; the School-to-Prison Pipeline</h2>

  <p class="research-intro">
    Tony Jackson&rsquo;s work confronts how bias and disproportionality push Black boys into the
    school-to-prison pipeline. In his research poster,
    <strong>&ldquo;Our Stories Matter, But Do They? Little TJ&rsquo;s Journey, Bias, Disproportionality,
    and the School-to-Prison Pipeline&rdquo;</strong>, he uses the story of &ldquo;Little TJ&rdquo;
    to show how early labels and discipline decisions can follow a student from kindergarten into adulthood.
  </p>

  <div class="research-grid">
    <article>
      <h3>The Narrative: Little TJ&rsquo;s Story</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Elementary School (K–5):</strong> Little TJ&rsquo;s high energy is interpreted as
          &ldquo;defiance,&rdquo; leading to repeated behavior referrals instead of support.</li>
        <li><strong>Middle School (6–8):</strong> Academic challenges and isolation grow as he is placed
          in more restrictive settings and separated from peers and curriculum.</li>
        <li><strong>High School (9–12):</strong> Suspensions and contact with School Resource Officers increase,
          creating a direct path from the classroom to the justice system and limiting post-secondary options.</li>
      </ul>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Critical Frameworks</h3>
      <p>
        Tony analyzes Little TJ&rsquo;s experience through critical lenses that reveal:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>How Black boys are often viewed as inherently disruptive or criminal rather than in need of support.</li>
        <li>How disability labels and restrictive placements can be used as tools for exclusion from general education.</li>
        <li>How structural racism in policies and practices produces and maintains disproportionate outcomes.</li>
      </ul>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Why This Work Matters</h3>
      <ul class="research-stats">
        <li><strong>40%</strong> of students expelled each year are Black.</li>
        <li><strong>70%</strong> of students referred to law enforcement or arrested at school are Black or Latinx.</li>
        <li>Black students are <strong>3.5× more likely</strong> to be suspended than White peers.</li>
        <li>Black and Latinx students are <strong>2× more likely</strong> not to graduate from high school.</li>
        <li><strong>68%</strong> of people in state and federal prisons do not have a high school diploma.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="research-callout">
        Tony&rsquo;s work calls educators and policymakers to move from bias to equity by transforming how we label
        students, design special education services, and use school discipline.
